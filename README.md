# Introduction to React-Native and Apollo-Client

Using [Github's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) as a backend, we'll be working on a small client app in ‚öõÔ∏è React-Native and üöÄ Apollo-Client. This app will serve as a playground, and help us cover these topics:
* getting started with react-native: using expo vs. building projects with native code
* handling routing via react-navigation
* setting up apollo-client and executing some basic operations (queries, mutations)
* offline support
* styling using styled-components
